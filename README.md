# Stroke-Prediction

## Introduction
A Stroke Prediction Machine Learning (ML) project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having a stroke in the future based on various risk factors such as age, gender, medical history, lifestyle habits, etc. The goal of such a project is to identify individuals at high risk of having a stroke and provide early intervention to prevent the occurrence of a stroke. Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide and early detection and prevention can greatly improve the outcome of a stroke. The ML model can be trained on a large dataset of patient information and use various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, etc. to make predictions. The project can also be extended to include personalized recommendations for lifestyle changes, medications, and other interventions to reduce the risk of a stroke. The model can also be integrated with healthcare systems to provide real-time predictions and support for healthcare providers to make informed decisions.

## Data Source

The "Stroke Prediction Dataset" on Kaggle is a available dataset that can be used to train a Stroke Prediction Machine Learning model. The dataset contains various features such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, and others that can be used as input features to predict the likelihood of a person having a stroke. The dataset contains 5110 observations with 12 attributes, and is available at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset
