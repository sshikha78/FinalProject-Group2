# Stroke-Prediction code by Aaron

## Code Portion 
The code for my portion is in the mywork.py file. It is important to run the code in order. Smote and feature reduction was taken from my group member to enhance my models and is not my work. 

In this file you will see my portion of EDA and the MLP Classifier model and their optimization history using RFE, PCA, and GridSearchCV. You will also see the use of the Keras models I have implemented. Each model has their own plots and metrics reprot.
